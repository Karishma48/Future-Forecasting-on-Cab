ðŸš– #Future Forecasting on Cab Data
Excited to share a recent achievement as a Data Analyst Team Leader at Betechnos Technology Private Limited!

In this project, I developed an optimization model for future demand forecasting in the cab industry using Python. The workflow included:

ðŸ“… Synthetic Data Generation using datetime, random, and timedelta libraries to simulate realistic cab ride data

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive data cleaning, handling missing values, and removing outliers to ensure data quality

ðŸ“Š Visualization:

Line chart to display Daily Ride Counts

Scatter plot to examine the relationship between Ride Count and Price

ðŸ“ˆ Modeling & Prediction:

Used train_test_split and LinearRegression from Scikit-learn

Achieved a 91% accuracy score on test data

Visualized trends to support future demand optimization

This project helped us uncover valuable patterns in cab usage and predict future demand with high accuracy â€” a key asset for planning and resource allocation.
